# Monorepo Project generated from node-monorepo-template

Use `yarn new <package-name>` to create a new package.

Also, once a package has been created, in order for publishing to be possible, it also needs an explicit `"private": false` in its package.json in order to be publisheable by lerna publish.

Helper command `yarn wizard` will pop up a menu with useful things you can do, you have even more available options using `yarn lerna --help`.

Please remember to replace this readme with something more project centered! Cheers~
